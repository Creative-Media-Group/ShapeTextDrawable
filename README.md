When it comes to draw basic shapes such as squares or circles, we encounter many approaches to achieve this goal. Using `Paint` is one of the best approach and yet it is still easier to use an **XML** shape or even an image. Now if we need to have some text inside our shape, then we usually surrender to the easiest and less time consuming solution. This library intends to avoid this "easy" choice by providing a flexible solution to efficiently draw your shapes and display efficiently some text inside them.

| Square shape                    | Round Square shape                          | Round shape                   |

## Download

Gradle:

```groovy
compile 'com.github.stephenvinouze:shapetextdrawable:1.0.0'
```

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.stephenvinouze</groupId>
  <artifactId>shapetextdrawable</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  <type>aar</type>
</dependency>
```

Eclipse: [shapetextdrawable-1.0.0.aar](https://github.com/StephenVinouze/ShapeTextDrawable/releases/download/1.0.0/shapetextdrawable-1.0.0.aar)

## Usage

`ShapeTextDrawable` can be applied to any `View` as a `Drawable`. For instance, you can use it on a `ImageView`.

```xml
<ImageView
        android:id="@+id/image_view"
        android:layout_width="50dp"
        android:layout_height="50dp"/>
```

Next define your `ShapeTextDrawable` and apply it to your `ImageView`.

```Kotlin
val drawable = ShapeTextDrawable(shapeForm)

yourImageView.setImageDrawable(drawable)
```

While configuring your `ShapeTextDrawable`, you must provide a `ShapeForm` that can be either `SQUARE` or `ROUND`. You may also specify a text and customize its color as well as many other properties, but none of these are mandatory.

To draw a rounded square, you can also set a `radius` when using a `SQUARE` shape.

```Kotlin
val drawable = ShapeTextDrawable(ShapeForm.SQUARE, radius = 10f)
```

## Credits

This library is mostly inspired from the well-written [TextDrawable](https://github.com/amulyakhare/TextDrawable). It was revisited to lighten this library and port it to **Kotlin**
